Maybe I'm wrong, maybe you're wrong, too
I kicked her in the mouth, but it wasn't my fault
She rubbed her ass and I got a hard-on
You weren't there for me, where were you
Baby's got herself to blame
She's spinning around me like a yule log
You could have forgiven me, why did you just leave
I was out of my mind, my head was spinning
I don't answer her, I've already jerked off
I thought about you, but I quickly lost it
I thought about you, but I quickly forgot
I thought I was in love, but I never was
I never think about us anymore
I don't give a fuck about you: I don't need you anymore
You'll never fuck with me again
Fucking pissing me off like that
So I'm doing it again
I just want to swim some more again
I stink, I'm like a toilet bowl of stink
I just keep going downhill
I'm not making tracks, yeah, I'm making money
You're not making money, you're making pennies
I see you've been working hard. How's it going
I don't give a fuck about the fans, I get high on the charts
I don't make tracks like I used to, fuck you
I traded a girl for a skank
I traded my friends for this fame
I'd sell my soul, where's the devil
Maybe I'm wrong, you're wrong too
I gave her a mouthful, but it wasn't my fault
She rubbed her ass and I got a hard-on
You weren't there for me, where were you
Baby's got herself to blame
She's spinning around me like a yule log
You could have forgiven me, why'd you just walk away
I was out of my mind, my head was spinning
I'm not answering her, I've already jerked off
I thought about you, but I quickly lost it
I thought about you, but I quickly forgot
I thought I loved you, but I never did
